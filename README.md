StatLog
=======

StatLog continuously queries a target Apache server with mod_status enabled gaining information about the clients connecting, which vhost they're using, and what URL they are attempting to access. This can be used to discover hidden admin/debug portals, ongoing attacks in remote sites, botnet C&amp;C, sessionIDs in URLs, and some other fun tricks.
